# Bike Sharing
## Overview
I took a two-weeks trip to New York City with my friend exploring historical landmarks. My realization on this trip was that one of the key ingredients that made the trip magical was "citi bike". I biked everywhere which allowed me to really get to know the city and interact with the people who live there and also use bikes for their commute. Being business minded, I would like to start a similar bike-sharing business for my hometown of Des Moines. I have come across a potential investor who might be interested in providing seed funding to explore a bike-sharing program in Des Moines. The mechanics of making this business work will be quite different in Des Moines than in New York City. I have therefore, decided to first of all find more about how the bike-sharing business works in New York City then I create a proposal of how it might work in Des Moines.  

In this project, I will use visualizations that tell a story to present a business proposal for the bike-sharing company using the data analysis visualization tool, Tableau. Worksheets, dashboards, and stories will be created to visualize key data from a New York Citi Bike dataset.

## Results
The data of the Citi Bike program in New York City is contained in a CSV. The August 2019 data to be specific was used because there is likely more traffic during the summer months. From our visualizations with Tableau, the number of rides for August 2019 was 2,344,224. I also determined the number of short-term customers and annual subscribers to the Citi Bike service. This will help predict the types of customers to be expected for a bike-sharing company in Des Moines. The proportion of short-term customers to the annual subscribers was found using a pie chart. The number of customers was 443,865 while the number of subscribers was 1,900,359.

The peak usage hours for the month of August was figured out using a horizontal bar chart. This will help the investors get a ballpark estimate of how many bikes might be needed in Des Moines and also figure out during which parts of the day bikes will be needed the most. This way, if maintenance is required on a bike, knowing the peak usage hours will help make plans on the best time to do that. The bar graph is shown below:

From the above graph, the top riding hours during August in New York City were 5pm and 6pm.
