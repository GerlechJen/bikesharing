# Bike Sharing
## Overview
I took a two-weeks trip to New York City with my friend exploring historical landmarks. My realization on this trip was that one of the key ingredients that made the trip magical was "citi bike". I biked everywhere which allowed me to really get to know the city and interact with the people who live there and also use bikes for their commute. Being business minded, I would like to start a similar bike-sharing business for my hometown of . I have come across a potential investor who might be interested in providing seed funding to explore a bike -sharing program in . The mechanics of making this business work will be quite different in Demoine than in New York City. I have therefore, decided to first of all find more about how the bike-sharing business works in New York City then I create a proposal of how it might work in Demoint.  

In this project, I will use visualizations that tell a story to present a business proposal for the bike-sharing company using the data analysis visualization tool, Tableau. Worksheets, dashboards, and stories will be created to visualize key data from a New York Citi Bike dataset.
